- **AI Correlation**: <2 second insight generation
- **Dashboard**: 10-second update intervals

## 🚀 What Makes This Special

### 1. True Correlation
Unlike traditional monitoring that shows separate metrics, logs, and traces, our platform **correlates all three signals** to tell the complete story:

- **Metrics** show "WHAT" is happening (high rejection rate)
- **Logs** reveal "WHY" it's happening (invalid policy numbers)
- **Traces** pinpoint "WHERE" it's happening (policy validation function)

### 2. AI-Powered Intelligence
Our AI agent doesn't just collect data - it **analyzes and interprets**:

- Detects anomalies automatically
- Generates human-readable explanations
- Provides specific remediation steps
- Estimates fix complexity and time

### 3. Real-World Application
We built this around a **real business scenario** (insurance claims processing) that demonstrates:

- Business logic instrumentation
- Custom metrics for domain-specific insights
- Error handling and validation
- User experience impact analysis

## 🎯 Business Value

### 1. Faster Incident Response
